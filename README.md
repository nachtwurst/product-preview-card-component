## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### Continued development

I need more practice with CSS and HTML in general. This one was a nightmare for me. 

The mobile version was easy, but when I went to alter the CSS for desktop, something about how I designed the layout felt completely broken.
It seemed as though the elements of the main container were not really attached to it, and everything would scale separately with the window and fall apart. 
In the end I had to set the main container to a constant size for desktop mode. The stylesheet feels like a mess too. 
I don't think I should have had to have changed so many things under the @media query, if I had done it optimally.
